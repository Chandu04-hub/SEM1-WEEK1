    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>
        Hi there! I'm a second-year BTech student with a keen interest in technology and engineering. 
        I enjoy learning about the latest advancements in the field and exploring how they can be applied to solve real-world problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently studying at a college that is in the process of obtaining university status from the University Grants Commission (UGC). 
        This transition is an exciting time for all students and faculty, as it brings new opportunities for growth and development. 
        Iâ€™m looking forward to the enhanced educational experiences and resources that this change will bring.

        Outside of my studies, I have a passion for web development and enjoy creating websites and experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        I believe that having a strong foundation in web technologies is essential for any aspiring engineer or developer, 
        as it allows for the creation of innovative solutions and engaging user experiences. I'm excited to continue building my skills in this area.
