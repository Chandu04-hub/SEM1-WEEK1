    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    
    <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create webpages. 
        It consists of various elements that structure the content on the page. 
        For instance, when writing chemical formulas in HTML, you can use subscript and superscript tags.
        A common example is the formula for water, which is represented as H<sub>2</sub>O, 
        indicating that there are two hydrogen atoms. 
        Additionally, the pH scale is expressed as pH = -log[H<sup>+</sup>], where H<sup>+</sup> denotes the concentration of hydrogen ions,crucial for determining acidity.
