    <h1>Using Bold and Italics in HTML</h1>
    
    <p>
        HTML is a powerful language for creating <b>webpages</b>. It allows you to structure your content using various tags. 
        By using <i>italic</i> tags, you can emphasize certain words, making them stand out. 
        Similarly, <b>bold</b> tags can be used to highlight important information or key terms. 
        Understanding how to use these tags effectively can greatly improve the <i>readability</i> and <b>appearance</b> of your content.
