    <h1>ABOUT HTML</h1>
    <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. 
        It provides the structure for content on the web by using a series of elements that define 
        headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Understanding HTML is essential for anyone 
        interested in web development, as it forms the foundation of all websites.
